## Description
<p>TenderSpace is a decentralized tendering application built on the Filecoin virtual machine. This application allows users to post tenders and receive bids on those tenders from interested parties. The application is designed to be fully decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority controlling the tendering process.

The application uses Filecoin storage helpers to store information related to tenders and bids. This ensures that all data is stored in a secure and decentralized manner, which enhances the overall security and transparency of the platform.</p>
